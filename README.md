My blog post "Cost optimize database migrations with AWS DMS: Part 1" provides a comprehensive guide on how to optimize costs when migrating databases using AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS). Here's a summary of the key points:

1. The post emphasizes the importance of cost optimization in database migration, focusing on efficient resource utilization and maximizing return on investment[1].

2. It outlines the main components of database migration: source database, target database, data migration tool/service, and schema conversion[1].

3. The blog discusses various factors affecting migration costs, including AWS DMS replication instance usage, instance type, deployment type, storage volume, and data transfer[1].

4. It introduces AWS DMS Serverless and AWS DMS homogenous data migrations as cost-effective alternatives to traditional AWS DMS instances[1].

5. The post provides guidance on selecting the right AWS DMS instance type based on workload characteristics:
   - Memory-intensive workloads
   - CPU-intensive workloads
   - Non-critical migrations
   - Burstable database migrations[1]

6. It offers a decision-making process for choosing the appropriate instance class, emphasizing the importance of conducting small-scale and full-scale test migrations[1].

7. The blog explains how to estimate memory requirements for migration tasks, considering factors like LOB columns, parallel table loading, and commit rates[1].

8. It also touches on CPU and storage requirements for migration tasks[1].

9. The post is part one of a two-part series, with the second part focusing on evaluating and scaling AWS DMS instance size and further cost optimization techniques[1].

Overall, your blog provides valuable insights and practical advice for organizations looking to optimize costs while migrating databases using AWS DMS[1][2].
